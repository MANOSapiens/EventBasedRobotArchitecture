# ðŸ¦ŽEventBasedRobotArchitecture

EventBasedRobotArchitecture is a custom backend for LEGO EV3 robots based on the ev3dev operating system. Designed by Chenpan Li from the **MANOSapiens Team** at the Martin-Andersen-NexÃ¶ Gymnasium Dresden, this innovative firmware introduces an event-driven architecture that enables highly efficient and precise task execution for robotic systems.

## Key Features

- **Event Loop-Based Architecture**  
  The system operates on an event loop where each task is defined by:
  - **Spawn Condition**: Specifies when the task should begin.
  - **Action Part**: Executes the core functionality of the task.
  - **Termination Condition**: Determines when the task concludes.

- **High-Performance Loop Rate**  
  Achieves an impressive **600 Hz loop rate**, allowing for rapid and precise execution of even the most complex sequences.

- **Compiler Integration**  
  A separate **Compiler** repository converts user-defined round sequences into structured tasks. These tasks are uploaded to the EV3 brick, streamlining the programming workflow.

- **Flexibility for Complex Sequences**  
  The architecture supports intricate execution flows, saving significant time and enhancing precision during robot operation.
